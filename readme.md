# OrderSoft server

## In development
OrderSoft as a whole, including the server, is currently in active development. Some parts may not be implemented at all, and others may be extremely buggy or unusable.

## why node.js?
* I've had previous experience with node.js
* Performance is not (too much of) an issue
* JS is extremely (overly?) forgiving
* As long as we are careful, we should not run into any issues with the type system ("1" + 4 == "14"?????)

message from the future: node was a bad idea

## how to run
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## licence info
All effort is taken in including and following licences where required. This in-development version of the software is distributed under an MIT licence, and was created for educational purposes (no matter how commercial it may seem).
